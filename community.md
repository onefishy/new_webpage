#### Women in Data Science 
From 2018-2022, I organized the data science workshop for the annual Women in Data Science Cambridge (WiDS) conference: [WiDS Datathon Workshop 2022](https://onefishy.github.io/wids_datathon/). From 2021-2022, I served as the co-director of the [Worldwide WiDS Datathon](https://www.widsconference.org).

#### Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging at Harvard
I am the organizer of OMPP's [Data Science Pedagogy Winter Workshop](https://onefishy.github.io/data-science-workshop/) for educators of underrepresented college students in data science. I am also the faculty advisor of the [OMPP Graduate Advisory Committee](https://iacs-gac.github.io/pages/about.html) and the facilitator of the [OMPP Diversity, Inclusion, Leadership Reading Group](https://onefishy.github.io/DIL_in_tech/reading_group.html). 

#### Community Building at Harvard
I am a member of the Senior Common Room at Leverett House. I am also a co-organizer of the OMPP/CS Communitas -- please [reach out](/advising.html) if you have ideas for food, activities or programming for Communitas!

#### PhD and Early Career Mentoring
I'm the faculty mentor of the SEAS PhD Working Group, a working group for masters and undergraduate students who are interested in receiving support and mentorship through their PhD application process. [Sign up for the PhD Working Group](https://forms.gle/cyVFBi5qoNw96DNW6).
