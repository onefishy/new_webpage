I'm the Assistant Director for Graduate Studies in Data Science at Harvard University. I'm also a machine learning researcher in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/) (DtAK). I am interested in building machine learning models with properties that align with task-specific desiderata and human values, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satisfaction of domain-specific constraints.

In a former life, I did research in pure math (specifically [algebraic topology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2118.pdf)) and was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College of California.
