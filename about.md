I'm the Assistant Director for Graduate Studies in Data Science at Harvard University. I'm also a machine learning researcher in the [Data to Actionable Knowledge lab](https://dtak.github.io/) (DtAK). I am interested in building machine learning models with properties that align with task-specific desiderata and human values, such as interpretability, risk-awareness, satisfaction of domain-specific constraints.

In a former life, I did research in pure math (specifically [algebraic topology](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1206.2118.pdf)) and was an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Saint Mary's College of California (*2009-2015*), where I focused on STEM community building, outreach and mentorship for first-generation college students and students from historically minoritized backgrounds.

My education is the peculiar product of an [early-college-entrance program](https://marybaldwin.edu/peg/) at an historically women's college (*1997-2001*), a PhD from a [liberal-arts focused research university](https://www.wesleyan.edu/mathcs/) (*2005-2009*), a mid-career-change inspired [master's](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/graduate-programs), and post-doctoral tours at young research centers born of old institutions in [Germany](https://www.uni-goettingen.de/en/90653.html) (*2011-2013*) and the [US](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu) (*2017-2020*).
