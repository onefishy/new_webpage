title: Advising
---

I advise students enrolled in SEAS Master's programs in Data Science and Computational Science & Engineering, theses students (undergraduate, masters and PhD), and research students (undergraduate and graduate). I am also happy to provide mentorship or support to students in the broader SEAS community. Students can find me through the following channels.

0. Research Advising
  - If you are interested in research supervision please email me or drop by an Open Office Hour.
  - New research students should carefully read the [on-boarding document on developing fundamental skills in research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQIupyrH7z2sUUH99CMQQJc9JzV8reTzQ6RYOeWQ1tE/edit?usp=sharing)

1. Spring 2024 Open Office Hours:
  - Tuesdays 1pm-3pm, SEC 2.341 (Note that this is a new location)

2. Email: ``weiweipan (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu``. Please prioritize using my open office hours -- my responses to emails will be *slow*. If you plan to email, please preface the email subject with ``[ADVISING]``; advising emails without this preface in the subject may go unanswered.
