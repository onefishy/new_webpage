I advise students enrolled in the IACS Master's programs, theses students (undergraduate and masters), and research students (undergraduate and graduate). I am also happy to provide mentorship or support to students in the broader SEAS community. Students can find me through the following channels.

0. Research Advising
  - If you are interested in research supervision please email me or drop by an Open Office Hour.
  - New research students should carefully read the [on-boarding document on developing fundamental skills in research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EQIupyrH7z2sUUH99CMQQJc9JzV8reTzQ6RYOeWQ1tE/edit?usp=sharing)
