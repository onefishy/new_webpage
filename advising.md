title: Advising
---

I advise students enrolled in the IACS Master's programs, theses students (undergraduate and masters), and research students (undergraduate and graduate). I am also happy to provide mentorship or support to students in the broader SEAS community. Students can find me through the following channels.

1. **Spring 2023 Open Office Hours** 
  - Tuesday, Thursday TBA in *SEC 2.341*
  - Wednesday, Friday TBA in *SEC 2.341*

2. **Email:** ``weiweipan (at) g (dot) harvard (dot) edu``. Please prioritize using my open office hours -- my responses to emails will be *slow*. If you plan to email, please preface the email subject with ``[ADVISING]``; advising emails without this preface in the subject may go unanswered.
